Technologies used: React.js, HTML, CSS

● Created a user-friendly and responsive interface using React components, HTML, and styled it using CSS to provide an engaging user experience.              
● Implemented React state management to keep track of the total number of heads and tails tossed. The state is updated every time a user clicks the button to simulate a coin toss.                                 
● Developed a button click event handler in React that randomly determines whether the result is heads or tails and updates the state accordingly.
